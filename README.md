## About

PolymerBase is a member of the Polymer framework family, designed to empower developers in building sophisticated applications. This framework utilizes Terraform for provisioning Serverless resources within the AWS Cloud Infrastructure, while also facilitating the establishment of streamlined CI/CD pipelines through GitHub Actions. 

# Polymer Framework

1. [PolymerBase repository](https://github.com/algebananazzzzz/PolymerBase)
2. [PolymerBase-lite repository](https://github.com/algebananazzzzz/PolymerBase-lite)
3. [PolymerFront repository](https://github.com/algebananazzzzz/PolymerFront)
4. [PolymerFront-lite repository](https://github.com/algebananazzzzz/PolymerFront-lite)


## Configuration

Please refer to the example lambda configuration file for additional information:
[Example Configuration File](.polymer/lambda_config/example.{stage}.env.yml)


Configuration within PolymerBase consists of three key aspects:

1. Resource Configuration: This involves the setup and customization of the resources that the Backend Stack deploys, e.g. API Gateway, Lambda.

2. Application Configuration: Variables used in your application. Consists of parameters such as Cognito user and identity pool IDs, Apollo Client configuration, and S3 data bucket name

3. Content Configuration: Customize the title, description, and links within the authentication pages like signup, login, and forgot password. Modify this configuration in the .polymer/content/auth.content.yml file. 

Configuration is stored in YAML files, specific to CI/CD staging environments. General configuration files are located in .polymer/.config and should follow the format {stage}.env.yml (e.g., dev.env.yml for development).

Gatsby configuration files are found in .polymer/.gatsbyconfig folder, used to configure environment variables during bundling (gatsby build) or local development (gatsby develop). It should follow the format {stage}.env.yml (e.g., development.env.yml for development). An example usage: GATSBY_APOLLO_URI = http://localhost:4000

## Integrations

1. PolymerBase utilises the **Apollo framework** to create **Graphql** servers for production. Learn more about [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com). 

To create application configurations and graphql schema for use within the application utilizing the configuration details of DynamoDB tables and the S3 data bucket provided in the "infrastructure.yml" file:
```shell
python3 .polymer/gen.py
```

Configure the location of the files in infrastructure.yml
```yaml
schema_files:
  app_config_output: app/src/app_config.json
  graphql_schema_output: app/src/schema/models.graphql
```

An example of generated application configuration
```json
{
    "application_name": "Polymer",
    "dynamodb": {
        "user": {
            "table_name": "users-Polymer",
            "key_attributes": {
                "id": "S",
                "userId": "S"
            },
            "attributes": {
                "name": "S",
                "description": "S"
            },
            "hash_key": "userId",
            "range_key": "id",
            "child": "posts"
        },
    },
    "s3": {
        "data_bucket": {
            "name": "polymer-s3-data"
        }
    }
}
```

2. It integrates with the **[WebPack]()** framework for efficient bundling for production. 

GitHub Actions will automatically generate production bundle for deployment:
```shell
cd app
npm run build
```

## Resources

Here are the resources that PolymerBase will deploy if specified, along with instructions on how to configure them:

1. **S3 Data Bucket** to store Application Content

Under s3, you can choose the name for S3 bucket to be provisioned
```yaml
s3:
  data_bucket:
    name: polymerbase-data
```

2. **Lambda functions** for executing compute operations. Polymer will automatically provision CodeDeploy resources for All-At-Once deployment.

Under lambda, you can specify multiple functions, and where to source its production files from
```yaml
lambda:
  polymerbase:
    function_name: PolymerBase-%s-function # %s will be replaced by stage e.g. dev
    basedir: app/dist
    envfile_basedir: .polymer/lambda_config 
  polymerhandler:
    function_name: PolymerHandler-%s-function # %s will be replaced by stage e.g. dev
    basedir: app/handler
    envfile_basedir: .polymer/lambda_config 
```

3. **API Gateway Integration** for exposing API endpoints.

Under api_lambda_integration, you can which lambda functions require API Gateway Integrations
```yaml
api_lambda_integration:
  polymerbase:
    cors_configuration: 
      allow_origins: 
        - "*"
      allow_methods: 
        - OPTIONS
        - GET
        - POST
      allow_headers: 
        - "*"
      expose_headers: 
        - "*"
      max_age: 300
    cors_handler_name: cors-preflight-handler
```


4. **Cognito Identity and User Pools**.

Under cognito, you can configure attributes for your Cognito Identity and User Pools. Currently, the identity pool is set up with an authenticated role, enabling access to the provisioned data bucket. However, ongoing efforts are being made to introduce a customized IAM role, enhancing flexibility and control in this aspect.
```yaml
cognito:
  usergroups:
    - admin
    - user
  cognito_custom_css: null
  custom_attributes:
    labels:
      type: S
      min_length: 0
      max_length: 2048
  identity_pool:
    name: ExampleIdentityPool
```


5. **DynamoDB Tables**.

Under dynamodb, you can specify multiple tables. The **attributes** attribute is used to specify non-key attributes e.g. name, required in `gen.py` to generate application configuration and schema definition.
```yaml
dynamodb:
  users:
    table_name: users-PolymerBase
    key_attributes:
      id: S
      userId: S
    attributes:
      key: S
      name: S
      description: S
    hash_key: userId
    range_key: id
    read_capacity: 2
    write_capacity: 2
    child: posts # used for defining GraphQL models i.e. field of [Posts] within type Users
  posts:
    table_name: posts-ProjectBalls
    key_attributes:
      id: S
      postId: S
      userId: S
    attributes:
      labels: NS
      likes: N
      name: S
      text: S
    hash_key: userId
    range_key: id
    global_secondary_index:
      postId-id:
        hash_key: postId
        range_key: id
        write_capacity: 2
        read_capacity: 2
        projection_type: "ALL"
    read_capacity: 2
    write_capacity: 2
```

5. **EventBridge Groups**.

Used to create multiple Eventbridge Groups
```yaml
eventbridge_schedule_group:
  - AnelaBotScheduler
```


## Installation

1. Clone the PolymerBase Framework
```shell
git clone https://github.com/algebananazzzzz/PolymerBase
```

## Deployment


1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
Start by creating a GitHub repository. After that, follow these steps to initialize Git and switch to the `dev` branch:
```
git init
git add -A
git commit
git checkout -b dev
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/{your_repository_name}.git
```

2. **Configure Secrets and Variables:**

For secure and streamline access to AWS and Terraform Cloud, follow these steps to configure secrets and variables within your GitHub repository:

- Click on the `Settings` tab within your repository.
- Navigate to `Secrets` (or `Environments` > `Secrets` depending on your GitHub version).
- Click on `New repository secret` to add secrets or `New repository variable` to add variables.

**Required Secrets:**

1. `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Your AWS access key ID.
2. `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Your AWS secret access key.
3. `TF_API_TOKEN`: Obtain this token by going to your [Terraform Cloud tokens page](https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens).

**Required Variables:**

1. `APPLICATION_NAME`: Set your application's name.
2. `AWS_REGION`: Define the AWS region you're working with.
3. `TF_ORGANISATION`: If not already created, create a Terraform Cloud organization for use.

3. **Push to GitHub**
```shell
git push --set-upstream origin dev
```

With GitHub Actions in place, this push will automatically trigger Terraform Cloud to provision the necessary resources.
